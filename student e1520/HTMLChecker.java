/**
   Write a program that checks whether a sequence of HTML tags
   is properly nested. For each opening tag, such as <p>, there
   must be a closing tag </p>. A tag such as <p> may have other
   tags inside, for example <p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <a> </a> </p>

   The inner tags must be closed before the outer ones.
   Your program should process a file containing tags.
   For simplicity, assume that the tags are separated by
   spaces, and that there is no text inside the tags.
